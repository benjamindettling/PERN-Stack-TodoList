## 💡 Challenges & Learnings

- 🚀 Built my **first full-stack application** using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js)
- 🧱 Learned how to structure a project with a separate frontend and backend
- 🗃️ Designed a PostgreSQL database and connected it to a Node.js API using Express
- 🎨 Practiced styling with **SCSS Modules** for clean and reusable styles
- 🌐 Gained experience deploying full-stack apps to production using Netlify and Render

> This project was my introduction to PERN-stack web development and laid a nice foundation for future React + backend projects.
